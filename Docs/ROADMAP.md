SolidShineUI Library Roadmap
============================

This is the general roadmap for the future of this library.

Unlike other roadmaps that I've made (or others that you may have seen online), this roadmap is based upon the year I plan to implement the given items and are not tied to a specific version.

This file will be edited as I make adjustments and changes. Nothing here is set in stone.

## Done

- Release version 1.7
- NuGet support
- .NET 5.0 support

## Very soon

- Release version 1.7.1 with minor changes

## 2021 (sooner)

- TabControl control (already in Experimental)
- Keyboard shortcut helper classes (already in use in some programs)
- Rewrite SelectPanel to not base from UserControl
- Rebase IntegerSpinner/DoubleSpinner under RangeBase class (breaking change)
- Improvements to FontSelectDialog
- Finish online documentation

## 2021 (later)

- Port to AvaloniaUI (once 0.10 comes out, will begin testing)
- Toolbar controls
- PropertyGrid control
- Touch/pen support for ImageColorPicker
  - (Keyboard support may be hard)

## 2022
