How to use:

In Visual Studio, right click on the XmlDocGen project item in the Solution Explorer, and then go to "Debug > Start New Instance" (OR select "XmlDocGen" from the startup projects list and go from there).

In VS Code, open the Run and Debug pane. Make sure that ".NET Core Launch (console)" is selected, and then click on Start Debugging.

Note that the resulting "docs" folder will be in either "/bin/Debug" or "/bin/Release" depending upon which build configuration is currently set.
